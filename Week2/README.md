### 📝 Assignment 2: Accessing Nested Properties in an Object  
Retrieve a value from a deeply **nested object** based on a **dot-separated property path**, without using a function.

#### 📌 Requirements:
- Define a **nested object** (at least 3 levels deep).

- Return an object with the **remaining inventory count** (purchases - sales).
- Items with `0` inventory should be removed.

---

### 📝 Assignment 4: Warehouse Inventory Analysis  
Implement two functions:

- `getTotalValue(warehouse)`: Calculates the **total value** of inventory per category.
- `findMostExpensive(warehouse)`: Finds the **most expensive product** in the warehouse.

#### 📌 Requirements:
- Categorize inventory items and calculate their total value.
- Identify the most expensive product in the warehouse.

---

### 📝 Assignment 5: Print an Isosceles Triangle  
Write a program that prints an **isosceles triangle** using the `*` character.

#### 📌 Requirements:
- Accept an integer `n` (triangle height).
- Print a centered isosceles triangle.
- Bonus: Allow users to choose the character.

---

### 📝 Assignment 6: Console-Based Area Calculator  
Create an **interactive** console-based area calculator using functions.

#### 📌 Requirements:
- Implement functions to calculate the area of **Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, Square**.
- Prompt users for shape selection and dimensions.
- Display the area in the console.
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
