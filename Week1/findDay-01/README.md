# Find the Name of the Day

A simple command-line application written in JavaScript that determines the name of the day in a week based on user input. It utilizes a `switch-case` statement to map numbers (1-7) to their respective weekday names.

- **Day Name Mapping**: Displays the corresponding day of the week.
